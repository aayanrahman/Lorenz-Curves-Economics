# Lorenz Curves - Economics Project

This project visualizes Lorenz curves for selected countries using income distribution data. Lorenz curves are a common tool in economics to represent income inequality.

## Data Source 
The data used in this project is sourced from The World Bank and represents income distribution data for the following countries:
* Bolivia (2008)
* Mexico (2006)
* Philippines (2006)
* Ghana (2006)
* Vietnam (2006)
* Pakistan (2005)
* Belarus (2007)

## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **SciPy**

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
```

## Usage
1. Open the Colab Notebook: Open the lorenz_curve.ipynb notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the Code: Execute all the code cells to process the data and generate Lorenz curves for each country.
3. View and Save Output: The Lorenz curve plot will display within the notebook, and an image file named lorenz_curve.png will be saved in your Colab directory.
